# Plastic Eating Microbes: A Bioinformatical Review And Analysis

## Introduction

There is a tremendous waste in our culture of resources and of our environment.
Of the many issues such as energy, global warming, and the use of non-renewable resources, I see the enourmous accumulation of plastic waste as the least researched that still has a considerable environmental impact.
There are immediate solutions, such as biodegradable plastics, however, without a global effort that supercedes capitalistic endeavors, there will not be a solution to the plastic pandemic.
Therefore, other paths must be explored. 
Microbes have been observed partially degrading plastic in near-extreme envrionments (source).
I believe that we can find a novel biological based soltuion that not only biodegrades plastic but also can do so in a way that returns valuable resources.
